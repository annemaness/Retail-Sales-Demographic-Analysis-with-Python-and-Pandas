## 🧾 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from the Kaggle competition: [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data?select=transactions.csv). It includes historical sales data, store information, and transaction records, which are utilized to analyze and forecast store sales trends.

## ✅ Project Goals

- Clean and prepare real-world datasets for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
- Visualize findings using effective and interpretable plots.
- Summarize insights that can inform business decisions.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Highlights

- Loaded and inspected multiple datasets (e.g., sales, products, customers).
- Cleaned missing data and standardized column names.
- Explored revenue, customer behavior, and product performance.
- Created visualizations such as bar charts, heatmaps, and time series plots.
- Delivered insights on business metrics such as:
  - Top-performing products and categories
  - Revenue trends over time
  - Customer segmentation insights

## 💡 Key Insights

- Certain products consistently outperform others across all quarters.
- Revenue peaks in specific periods, aligning with seasonal promotions.
- Identified customer segments with higher repeat purchase behavior, suggesting loyalty opportunities.


## 📈 Future Improvements

- Incorporate interactive dashboards using **Plotly** or **Dash**.
- Apply clustering techniques for more detailed customer segmentation.
- Automate data cleaning steps with custom functions.
